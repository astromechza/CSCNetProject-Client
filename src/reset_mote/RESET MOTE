At times, the serial output can become corrupted if you run the programs after having disconnected and reconnected the mote, 

sadly this is an issue with the current MSP430 tool chain versions used to compile towards this architecture. 

One option gets around this, and that involves resetting the device. In order to perform this, you may either press the reset button on the mote -  which we would rather you do not do since it requires you to open up the mote. Another option is to reset the mote by use of the z1-bsl-nopic program included here. 

The usage is simple: ./z1-bsl-nopic --z1 -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -r

This is all you should need - however you should take care to have the pyserial package installed on your system, I have included the package with the previous uploads. This should be installed already on your systems in the third year labs.
