 * At the moment this is the main class. Guessing that in future it could be run like:
 * $ java SensorClient						( spawn a client to send stuff to the server on an auto port )
 * $ java SensorClient --serverport 54321	( a specific server port )
 * $ java SensorClient --comport 1			( a specific serial port )
 * 
 * So the first thing might be to do proper argument parsing.
 * 
 * Hopefully if we design this properly we can run multiple sensor clients at once without interfering.
