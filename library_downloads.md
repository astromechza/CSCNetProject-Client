Why this is here
==================

Instead of putting all these massive JS libraries here, I'm putting a list to
download. If you guys this is redudant, please push a copy! I'm including a
bash script to setup libraries as well, it'll setup all the folders and
download/unzip libraries.

Libraries to download
=====================
Put these in a folder called lib in the root folder of the project:
http://www.highcharts.com/downloads/zips/Highcharts-3.0.0.zip into a folder
called highcharts
