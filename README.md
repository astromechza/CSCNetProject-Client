CSCNetProject - Client
======================
Client for Participatory Cloud Computing

Structure
------------

Client provides the methods required by a client, including interfacing with
Punix.py to capture and record sensor data in a reasonable way. 


Testing
------------

I'm including (non-comprehensive) unit testing classes just to make it easy to
check for compatability on senior lab computers and to make sure I'm not going
insane. At the moment, we have:

TestClient.py: Tests, strangely, Client.py

Libraries
-------------
Libraries aren't included. There's a list in library\_downloads.md and a script to automatically set up libraries in library\_setup.sh.
